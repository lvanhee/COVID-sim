The .bat file allows computing and displaying the core variables under study for the scenario 6.
For running it from you own computer, you just have to update the location of the .exe files in the .bat file such that it matches your setup.

Note that this a first version set up for my own config for not having to fiddle around too much with issues; bugs might still be in there.
